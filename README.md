# Scoop Bucket

A scoop bucket with applications I use that aren't available on `main` or `extras`.

## Applications

The applications this bucket provides:

- [Keymapper](https://github.com/houmain/keymapper): A cross-platform context-aware key remapper.

## Usage

1. Add the bucket to scoop.

   ```powershell
   scoop bucket add cmvanb https://github.com/cmvanb/scoop-bucket/
   ```

2. Install an application from this bucket.

   ```powershell
   scoop install keymapper
   ```
